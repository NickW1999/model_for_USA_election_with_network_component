# model_for_USA_election_with_network_component
This repository contains analyses of the optimal states to campaign in for an American presidential election based on a simulated network model. 
This model includes a network component based on the social connetedness index (SCI).
For more in detail information about the model it is possible to read my thesis that is also added here.
I would not recommend running the data cleaning part.
It takes quite a while and the raw data is not included here (due to size), but the links to the raw data can be found in my thesis.
Note that the SCI is not add to the files it can be found here https://data.humdata.org/dataset/social-connectedness-index.
